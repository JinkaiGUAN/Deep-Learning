In this project, we build a classifier based on MobileNet V2. All the code used in this project is stored in the folder 'emotion_classification'. By running main.py, yu can see the log stored in folder 'result'. As for the data, it is stored in the 'Data' folder, where the folers laberled by int number are what we need.  

Future Work:
1. Add a process bar to see the process of the training and valiadtion, before which, we could add a command line. 
2. Add a GUI to see the plot of loss and accuracy.
3. Add a GUI to see the predition of the imput file. In this GUI, we need two sub-windows to show the input picture and the prediction, also a pup-up getting the filename needed.
